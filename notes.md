1. Watch a very short videos on overall what JQuery is before getting to specific 
    * Find videos spefically on JQuery benefits 
    * [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ91pzGZ9p4) video did a good job and showing me it's benefits over DOM that we just learned 
2. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXggB-T1jQ) video that covers a lot of JQuery in about an hour
    * As I watch i'm going to look for resources as the video brings up concepts
    * The video splits things into different section so I'll stop and practice each section 
3. Find a good jQuery cheatsheet/resource
